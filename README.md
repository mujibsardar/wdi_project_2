Welcome to the first web application that allows you to leave feedback and search for qualified Home-Health Nurses. It's overall aim is to expand on and strengthen nurses resume and professional online presence while at the same time allow non-nurse users to find a nurse they feel comfortable working with. This is the skeleton version of any production ready version of the application.  

This readme will address the following topics: 

  - Getting Started with Nurseview
  - Current Functionality
  - Vision For Future Releases
  - Business Model
  - Technologies Used

### Getting Startd with Nurseview

Getting started as a user is easy as pie. Nurseview is currently hosted on heroku and can be accessed by pointing your web browser to: https://protected-refuge-39236.herokuapp.com/ 
(nurseview.com is $777 ðŸ˜ž )    
To run this code locally on your machine (Mac OS-X) do the following:
- Make sure you have ruby and rails installed on your machine
- In bash run the command | rails db:create | within the project folder
- Again in bash run | rails db:migrate | 
- Then run the rails server using the command |  rails server |

Point your web browser to: localhost:3000 and voila you got an almost empty page ðŸ˜›
To add data sign up as a nurse multiple times (at least 6) and include an image URL each time. 

### Current Functionality

On the home page you can view all the nurses that signed up (or added) through the application. You can do the following: 

- Search for a nurse by using the search bar on top of the page
-- Search is case sensitive and searches within the name column which includes first name  and last name as one string
- Sign up as a regular user or a nurse
-- There are two different versions of the sign up form depending which sign up form you clicked.  
- Leave a review for a nurse (if signed up and logged in)
-- You can leave a line of text along with a score between 0-100
- View all the reviews you have left for others
-- You have the option to delete a review you have left here
- View profile page with all relevant information for each nurse listed in the system
-- Location, Type of Nurse, Home Health Agency affiliation etc.
- Edit your profile information
-- Both Nurses and regular users can edit their info

### Vision For Future Releases

- The appplication shall allow users to perform complex search queries
- The application shall allow uploading images from the users local machine
- The application shall allow communications between users specifically between a non-nurse user and nurse

### Business Model

Revenues will be generated by charging Home-Health agencies to contact and access certain nurse data relevant to them. However before revenue stage can be reached the application has to succeed in enticing Nurses to get listed on Nurseview. All other details are left open at this stage.
